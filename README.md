This is a python script that generates infinite copies of the bmovie to the location where the script is opened. 
On my system it generates about 9,000 files per minute (500 mb) or 30gb/hr. Please do not use this program to trick 
your friends and fill their hard drives with copies of the Bee Movie script. 

That is not the intention of this program. 

You should only use this program if you want to fill your own HDD with copies of the Bee Movie script. I've heard 
stories. Terrible stories of people taking this program, changing the filename and icon to a commonly used app on a 
friend's PC, and then not explaining to them why their HDD was being filled with copies of the Bee Movie script. This 
is clearly unethical and it makes me sad every time someone messages me telling me that they have done it. Some say 
that there shouldn't be an app to fill a directory with copies of the Bee Movie script. I understand but I disagree. 
Those who want to fill their HDDs with copies of the Bee Movie script deserve tools to help them do so and I'm here 
to provide that to them. I am not responsible for the sickening things that some people may use this program for. You 
take full responsibility for your actions when you download bmovie. 

Please use it wisely. Please use it to consensually fill HDDs with copies of the Bee Movie script. 

God bless America.
